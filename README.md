<h2 align="center"> 🛡️ Caesar Cipher - Encrypt & Decrypt Text in Python 🛡️</h2>

This is a Python implementation of the classic **Caesar Cipher** encryption technique. The program allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** text by providing a custom **shift value**.

## ✨ Features ✨

* Encrypt any text using Caesar Cipher
* Decrypt text back to original form
* Customizable shift values
* User-friendly terminal interface

## 🧪 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

* A → D
* B → E
* Z → C

You can also reverse the process to decrypt.

##  Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system

### 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pys07/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
cd PRODIGY_CS_01
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to:

   * Enter your message
   * Provide a shift value
   * Choose encryption or decryption

## 🖥️ Example Output

```
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Program!
Enter your message: hello world
Enter the shift key (integer): 3
Encrypt or Decrypt? (e/d): e

Result (encrypted message):
khoor.zruog
```
